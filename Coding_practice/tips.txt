you are always not meant to look for the best time complexity
STAR- Situation Task Action Result

C notes below - 
 #line is used as a preprocessor to re-set the line number in the code
 The <bits/stdc++. h> is a header file. This file includes all standard library
 using namespace std ; defines the scope of all the variables that you want to use.
 The static variable retains its value between multiple function calls.
 Usage of Pointers - accessing array elements
 Dynamic memory allocation
 call by reference
 A pointer that can access all the 16 segments of RAM is called far pointer.
 When a pointer points to a deallocated memory it is known as a dangling pointer.
 Pointer to pointer contains the address of another pointer
 Static memory is assigned during the compile time and not during the run time and it is faster.
 malloc function allocates memory during allocation, intitializes it with the garbage value , where as calloc initializes it with the 0
 ptr = (cast-type*) calloc(n,element-size) where n is the number of elements

 ptr = realloc(ptr,newsize);
 free(ptr);
 union holds the memory of the largest variable only
 sprintf stands for string print - it returns the total number of characters in the string

 to run a progam without a main function
 #include<stdio.h>    
#define start main    
void start() {    
   printf("Hello");    
}

token is the smallest indvidual unit of the program
command line argument - arguments passed to the main function

getch() doesn't display the character while taking in whereas getche() displays it

Maximum lenght of an identifier - 32
